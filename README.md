## Result and Insights :

Sales fluctuate across months, with clear peak and drop periods indicating seasonal demand.
Smartphones lead in unit sales, while laptops and cameras generate the highest revenue.
Accessories contribute the largest share of total sales value among all categories.
A small group of top salespersons drives most of the revenue, while lower performers show improvement opportunities.
Sales performance varies by region, highlighting uneven market demand.

## Data Story :
The data shows that high-value products matter more than high-volume sales. While smartphones sell the most units, premium products like laptops and cameras bring in higher revenue. Sales are driven by a few strong performers and peak during certain months, suggesting seasonal trends and the importance of focused sales strategies. This dashboard turns raw data into insights that help understand what sells, who sells best, and when sales perform the strongest.
